Update User Profile

1. Create a userProfile object with the following properties
- name
- address
- city
- state
- zipcode
- avatar
2. Create a function performUpdate that takes in an object, a key, & new value. This fuction will create a new object with the key & value parameters & use the mixin pattern with Object.assign to return a new object that extends the object that was passed in.
3. Create another function called updateProfile that will take in the userProfile object that you've already defined.
  - Ask for the user to input a property that they want to update
  - Ask the user for the new value they want to set that property to
  - Update the profile using the performUpdate function
  - Log the old value of the property that was changed
  - Log the new value of the property that was changed
  - Log out the new profile object
